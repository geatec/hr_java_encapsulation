- Show complete demo to students on smartscreen
- Explain that areas of Squares, Rectangles, Circles and Ellipses are listed in descendingly sorted order,
  but Lines aren't included in the list, since they don't have an area.
- Explain that, to this end, Square, Rectangle, Circle and Ellipse implement (DO NOT YET SHOW HOW) the Surface interface with method getArea, whereas Line does not.
- Explain that implementation of Surface by Rectangle and Ellips is an obligation inherited from Square and Circle, rather than requiring repeated use of the "implements" keyword.
Remark: Class line was added since without it, abstract method getArea  could have simply been added to abstract class Shape.
- Explain (and show) how the bubble sort algorithm in class SurfaceSorter uses getArea.
- Show the implementation of getArea in Square and Rectangle but NOT in Cirlce and Ellipse.
- Don't distribute the source code of Circle and Ellipse, but have the student expand these classes with an implementation of getArea, that were treated in the previous lesson.
  The students can use Square.getArea and Rectangle.getArea as an example, and Google for the area formulae of Circle and Ellipse.

Class hierarchy in the end:

Shape                Surface
    Circle ------------+
        Ellipse        |
    Square ------------+
        Rectangle
    Line
    
- Abstract base classes and abstract methods are exemplified by the code of class Shape.
- The instanceof operator is exemplified in Canvas.add.
