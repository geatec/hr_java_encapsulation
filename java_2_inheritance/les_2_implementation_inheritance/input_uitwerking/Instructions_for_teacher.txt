- Show complete demo to students on smartscreen
- Especially explain CheckedInput.java, as it shows implementation inheritance
- Tell students to derive a class that repeats the question until an acceptable amount is given or a maximum repeat count is exceeded
- Don't distribute any .class files
- Don't distribute RepeatedInput.java, let students practice programming that themselves

Class hierarchy in the end:

CoinInput
    CheckedInput
        RepeatedInput
