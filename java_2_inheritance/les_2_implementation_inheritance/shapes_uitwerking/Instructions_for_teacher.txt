- Show complete demo to students on smartscreen
- Especially explain Circle.java and Square.java, as they show implementation inheritance
- Tell students to derive classes for Ellipses (with a second radius) and Rectangles (with a second side)
- Don't distribute any .class files
- Don't distribute Ellipse.java and Rectangle.java, let students practice programming those themselves

Class hierarchy in the end:

Shape
    Circle
        Ellipse
    Square
        Rectangle
